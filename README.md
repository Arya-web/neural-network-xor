# neural-network-xor
Implements a neural network learning XOR gate in your favourite languages !

# File architecture
To avoid problems, follow this architecture :
```
<root>
  |_ python
      |_ <username>
          |_ my file.py
          |_ network.py
  |_ java
      |_ <username>
          |_ Main.java
          |_ Test.java
``` 

To increase lisibility, I recommend to create only **ONE FILE**.
For instance, `main.py` should contains all the code needed to run the project.
